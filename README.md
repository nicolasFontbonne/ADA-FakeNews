# Abstract
The creation and propagation of false information has existed since the dawn of time.
Behind these misleading elements are often hidden political or financial intentions, in order to gain credit or make competitors lose it.
With the advent of the Internet and the ever faster and more direct flow of information, it is becoming easier every day to deceive your fellow citizens and to be fooled.
The term *fake news* took on a new dimension during the 2016 American presidential election, when Donald Trump used it extensively to describe the media coverage about himself. In this instantaneous era, it becomes crucial to be able to be critical of the information received. With this work, we want to highlight the risks related to the propagation of false information by using the fakes news themselves, from the Liar database. The power that these fake new vehicles hold is mostly in the use and resonance we make of them. Our credulity becomes credibility, it's up to us to turn the equation the other way around!
